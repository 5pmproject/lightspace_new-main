Format Configuration
description: A one-line explanation of the project and rules' purpose
globs: File patterns where these rules apply (ts, tsx, js, jsx, json, md)
alwaysApply: true: Apply these rules in all situations

Core Framework Version Specification
Like a recipe's ingredient list, we specify exact versions so Cursor can consider the characteristics of each version when generating code:

React 18.3.1's Concurrent Features
Vite 6.3.5's latest build optimizations
TypeScript ES2020 target configuration

Cursor will automatically perform the following tasks:

React 18.3.1 component generation using latest patterns
shadcn/ui components properly composed for UI construction
TypeScript type safety assurance
WCAG 2.1 AA standard accessibility automatically applied
Vite 6.3.5 optimized build configuration considerations
